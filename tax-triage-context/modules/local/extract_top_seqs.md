# EXTRACT_TOP_SEQS

## Overview
The `EXTRACT_TOP_SEQS` module is designed to extract top sequences (e.g., reads or contigs) for a given set of taxonomic IDs, typically for downstream analysis or reporting.

## Container
- Docker/Singularity: `biocontainers/biopython:1.75` (or `biopython:1.78` for Singularity)
- Conda: `conda-forge::python=3.8.3` (if enabled)

## Big Picture
This module is intended to extract and output the most relevant sequences for specified taxonomic IDs, which can be used for further analysis or visualization.

## Input
- `tuple val(meta), path(taxids)` (sample metadata and taxid file)

## Output
- `path("*fastq.gz")` (output fastq files for the top sequences)
- `path "versions.yml"` (software versions)

## Uses bin script?
- No external script from `bin/` is used; all commands are run directly in the script section (the actual extraction logic should be implemented here).

## Script Section
- (Placeholder) The script section is currently a placeholder and should be implemented to extract top sequences based on the input taxids.
- Writes out a `versions.yml` file with the Python version used.
